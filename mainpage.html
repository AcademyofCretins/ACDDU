<h2>"At the Academy of Cretins, our Mission is to introduce classical piano to the world."</h2>
<p><strong>We do not expect any of our students to become professionals, nor do we expect our students to understand classical piano music completely. We want to introduce classical piano music to them so students can decide if it <strong>really</strong> is the right thing for them; if they can pursue it as a hobby.<br>lWe want to make it clear that we only serve as a temporary bridge to lead the world into classical piano music.</p></strong>
